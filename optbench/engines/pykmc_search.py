"""pyKMC registry hook.

The lane name pyKMC is the SourceForge lkmc project, release 1.3
(M. Robinson, Loughborough), not the GitHub repository hockyg/PyKMC.
The 1.3 archive is Perl from February 2010. The kMC driver shells out
to ``LBOMD.exe``, which is not in the archive. There is no callback
the harness can wrap, and the tree has no licence file.
